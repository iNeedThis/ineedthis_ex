## Troubleshooting

If you are running Docker on Windows and the application crashes immediately upon startup, please ensure that `autocrlf` is set to `false` in your Git config, and then re-clone the repository. Additionally, it is recommended that you allocate at least 4GB of RAM to your Docker VM.

If you run into an Elasticsearch bootstrap error, you may need to increase your `max_map_count` on the host as follows:
```
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
```

If you have SELinux enforcing (Fedora, Arch, others; manifests as a `Could not find a Mix.Project` error), you should run the following in the application directory on the host before proceeding:
```
chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t .
```

This allows Docker or Podman to bind mount the application directory into the containers.

If you are using a platform which uses cgroups v2 by default (Fedora 31+), use `podman` and `podman-compose`.
